Resources for developers
------------------------

This folder contains various utils that may be of use if you plan to develop for or on top of OpenNaaS.

 * full-cim-router-model: A full Java dump of the CIM model. If in need to extend the router model, take classes from here.
 * codestyle: Eclipse codestyle file. We would very much appreciate if code contributions are formatted with this. There are instructions on how to link it to a Save action.
