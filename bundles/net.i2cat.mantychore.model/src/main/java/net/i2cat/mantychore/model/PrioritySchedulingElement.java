 * PrioritySchedulingElement is described as follows:

 * This class is a subclass of the abstract class SchedulingElement. It 
 * indicates that a scheduler is taking packets from a set of inputs using 
 * the priority scheduling discipline. As is the case with all subclasses of 
 * SchedulingElement, the input associated with an instance of 
 * PrioritySchedulingElement is of one of two types: either a queue, or 
 * another scheduler. The Priority property represents the priority for an 
 * input, relative to the priorities of all the other inputs to which the 
 * scheduler (that aggregates this PrioritySchedulingElement) is associated. 
 * Inputs to which the scheduler is related via other scheduling disciplines 
 * do not figure in this prioritization. Because scheduling of this type is 
 * always work conserving, the inherited boolean property, WorkConserving, is 
 * restricted to TRUE in this class.
