/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined 
 * in the CIM class Product as well as methods comparable to the 
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the 
 * ProductBean Interface. The CIM class Product is described as follows: 
 * 
 * CIM_Product is a concrete class that aggregates PhysicalElements, software 
 * (SoftwareIdentity and SoftwareFeatures), Services and/or other Products, 
 * and is acquired as a unit. Acquisition implies an agreement between 
 * supplier and consumer which may have implications to Product licensing, 
 * support and warranty. Non-commercial (e.g., in-house developed Products) 
 * should also be identified as an instance of CIM_Product. Note that 
 * software is handled a bit differently in the list of aggregated entities, 
 * above. This is because software can be viewed as a tangible asset (similar 
 * to PhysicalElements) AND/ OR as a set of features that make up a Product 
 * and are deployed. These are two different concepts, usually managed by 
 * different units in a business' organization. When software 'features' are 
 * described, the CIM_SoftwareFeature class from the Application Model is 
 * instantiated (where Features are Weak to/scoped by a Product). When a 
 * specific piece of software is acquired and perhaps warrantied as part of a 
 * Product, this is addressed by the class, SoftwareIdentity.
