/**

 * described as follows: 
 * 
 * FilterLists are defined in the context of a ComputerSystem (e.g., a router, 
 * firewall or host). Note that this class is deprecated since its 
 * subclassing is not correct. It subclasses from SystemComponent, but a 
 * FilterList is NOT a Component of a System. Instead, it is hosted/scoped by 
 * the System. In versions up to CIM 2.6, FilterListInSystem was a mandatory, 
 * Weak relationship. This is no longer true, beginning with CIM V2.7.
