/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined 
 * in the CIM class OpaqueManagementData as well as methods comparable to the 
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the 
 * OpaqueManagementDataBean Interface. The CIM class OpaqueManagementData is 
 * described as follows: 
 * 
 * A class derived from StorageExtent that describes opaque management data in 
 * managed systems. The structure and semantics of opaque management data, 
 * which may be standardized or proprietary, are assumed to be known by at 
 * least one management client, but need not be known by the CIM server. The 
 * UntransformedDataFormat property identifies the structure and semantics of 
 * the data. Opaque management data are typically stored in non-volatile 
 * memory that is accessible to the server. Management clients are able to 
 * read and write opaque data, to manage their lifetime, and to configure the 
 * access rights associated with them. The non-volatile storage is often used 
 * as a mailbox, with local management agents producing data for consumption 
 * by remote management clients, or vice versa. This class is not intended as 
 * a general-purpose opaque alternative to any existing or planned CIM 
 * classes. It is expressly intended for the mailbox usage model described 
 * above.
