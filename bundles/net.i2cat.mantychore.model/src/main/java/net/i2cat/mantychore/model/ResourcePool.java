 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined

 * follows: 
 * 
 * A ResourcePool is a logical entity (with associated controls)provided by 
 * the host system for the purpose of allocation and assignment of resources. 
 * A given ResourcePool may be used to allocate resources of a specific type. 
 * Hierarchies of ResourcePools may be created to provide administrative 
 * control over allocations. In the cases where resources are subdivided, 
 * multiple resource pools may exist (e.g. nodal boundaries in NUMA-like 
 * systems). In systems that support over commitment, pools represent the 
 * reservable capacity, not an upper bound or limit on the maximum amount 
 * that can be allocated. Admission control during power on may detect and 
 * prevent systems from powering due to resource exhaustion. For example, 
 * over commitment on a ResourcePool with ResourceType=Memory would require 
 * that sufficient space be available in some backing-store, that may be 
 * managed through a storage ResourcePool.
