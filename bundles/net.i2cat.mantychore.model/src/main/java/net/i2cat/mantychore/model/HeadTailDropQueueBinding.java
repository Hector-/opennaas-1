 * This association describes the relationship between a head or tail dropper 
 * and the queue that it monitors to determine when to drop traffic. The 
 * referenced queue's depth is compared against the Dropper's threshold 
 * property. Although the dropper drops from only one queue, the drop 
 * decision may be influenced by the state of several queues. The rule for 
 * combining the multiple inputs is simple addition: if the sum of the 
 * lengths of the monitored queues exceeds the dropper's QueueThreshold 
 * value, then packets are dropped. Note that this rule for combining inputs 
 * may be overridden.
