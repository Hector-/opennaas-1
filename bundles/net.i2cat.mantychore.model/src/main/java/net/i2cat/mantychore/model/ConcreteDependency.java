/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined 
 * in the CIM class ConcreteDependency as well as methods comparable to the 
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the 
 * ConcreteDependencyBean Interface. The CIM class ConcreteDependency is 
 * described as follows: 
 * 
 * CIM_ConcreteDependency is a generic association used to establish 
 * dependency relationships between ManagedElements. It is defined as a 
 * concrete subclass of the abstract CIM_Dependency class, to be used in 
 * place of many specific subclasses of Dependency that add no semantics, 
 * that is subclasses that do not clarify the type of dependency, update 
 * cardinalities, or add or remove qualifiers. Note that when you define 
 * additional semantics for Dependency, this class must not be subclassed. 
 * Specific semantics continue to be defined as subclasses of the abstract 
 * CIM_Dependency. ConcreteDependency is limited in its use as a concrete 
 * form of a general dependency. It was deemed more prudent to create this 
 * concrete subclass than to change Dependency from an abstract to a concrete 
 * class. Dependency already had multiple abstract subclasses in the CIM 
 * Schema, and wider industry usage and impact could not be anticipated.
