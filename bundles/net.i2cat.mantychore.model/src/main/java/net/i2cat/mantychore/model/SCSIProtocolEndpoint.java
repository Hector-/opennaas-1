 * logical SCSI port, independent of the connection/transport. 
 * SCSIProtocolEndpoint is either directly or indirectly associated to one or

 * the underlying transport. Indirect associations aggregate one or more 
 * LogicalPorts using intermediate ProtocolEndpoints (iSCSI, etc). 
 * SCSIProtocolEndpoint is also associated to a SCSIProtocolController,
