 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined

 * is described as follows: 
 * 
 * TextRedirectionService provides the capability to redirect a text console 
 * output to the remote console. For example, any text stream directed to a 
 * Serial COM Port (by the operating system) on a Computer System can be 
 * redirected out to a remote administrator's console. Similarly the text 
 * input keystrokes from the remote administrator's console can be redirected 
 * into the same COM Port. Each redirection stream is accessible via a 
 * TextRedirectionSAP. This service can support multiple redirection streams 
 * via multiple associated TextRedirectionSAPs.
