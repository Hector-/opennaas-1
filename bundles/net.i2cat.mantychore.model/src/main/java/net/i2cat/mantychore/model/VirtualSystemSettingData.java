 * system through a set of virtualization specific properties. 
 * CIM_VirtualSystemSettingData is also used as the top level class of

 * CIM_ConcreteComponent. Virtual system configurations may for example be 
 * used to reflect configurations of - virtual systems that are defined at a

 * input requests to create new virtual systems, - input requests to modify 
 * existing virtual systems, or - snapshots of virtual systems.
