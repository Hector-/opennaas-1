/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined

 * follows: 
 * 
 * A BGP Peer Group is a set of BGP neighbors that share the same update 
 * policies. This enables an administrator to assign policies to the peer 
 * group, instead of individually. This enables the routers in the Peer Group 
 * to optimize UPDATE messages. Consequently, Peer Groups have a set of 
 * restrictions that must be followed in order to work correctly with 
 * external BGP peers. Otherwise, loss of routing information could occur. A 
 * BGPPeerGroup is weak to the AutonomousSystem that contains it. Therefore, 
 * the keys from System must be propagated to it.
