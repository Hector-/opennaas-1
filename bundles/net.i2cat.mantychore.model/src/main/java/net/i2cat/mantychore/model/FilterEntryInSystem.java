 * All filter entries (FilterEntryBase and its subclasses) are defined in the 
 * context of a ComputerSystem/network device, where they are used to 
 * identify and act on network traffic. Note that this class is deprecated 
 * since its subclassing is not correct. It subclasses from System Component, 
 * but a FilterEntryBase is NOT a Component of a System. Instead, it is 
 * hosted/scoped by the System. In versions up to CIM 2.6, 
 * FilterEntryInSystem was a mandatory, Weak relationship. This is no longer 
 * true, beginning with CIM V2.7.
