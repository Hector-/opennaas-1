 * 
 * ProtocolService represents represents an application layer service 
 * available on a hosting system. Often times, the service name reflects the 
 * employed/supported communication protocol (e.g. file transfer - FTP), 
 * however in some other cases it does not. (e.g. mail notification service - 
 * biff). Access to the service is modeled with one or more instances of 
 * ProtocolEndpoint. This class represents the availability of the function 
 * on the system. Issuing a stop to this instance is equivalent to disabling 
 * the functionality and making it unavailable to users. Thus a stop of this 
 * service will result in the removing of all ProtocolEndpoints which are 
 * associated with the instance via ServicAccessBySAP. The functionality can 
 * be made available again by issuing a start to the service. This class 
 * contains service definitions which are currently needed. Future extensions 
 * are expected.
