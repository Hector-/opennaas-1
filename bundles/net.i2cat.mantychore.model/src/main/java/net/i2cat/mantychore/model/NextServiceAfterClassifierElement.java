 * An association used to establish a predecessor-successor relationship 
 * between a single ClassifierElement (within a ClassifierService) and the 
 * next ConditioningService object that further processes the selected 
 * traffic. Note that the cardinalities indicate that a FollowingService MUST 
 * be defined, after the ClassifierElement. This is because there is no
