 * RedirectionService provides the capability to manage redirection services. Examples of this include any video stream directed to a Network Port (by
 * the operating system) on a Computer System redirected out to a remote administrator's console. Similarly this can include input redirected into the

 * accessible via a SAP. This service can support multiple redirection types via multiple associated SAPs.
