/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined 
 * in the CIM class NextHopRouting as well as methods comparable to the 
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the 
 * NextHopRoutingBean Interface. The CIM class NextHopRouting is described as 
 * follows: 
 * 
 * NextHopRouting relates a destination address to the address or interface 
 * through which the remote address may be reached. An instance of this class 
 * can represent either static or dynamic routing, and may represent a 
 * routing table entry (but it is not required that all NextHopRoutes be in a 
 * routing table). Static routes are distinguished by setting the IsStatic 
 * boolean property to TRUE. Subclasses of NextHopRouting provide specific 
 * protocol and Key information. NextHopRoutes are dependent on at least one 
 * ForwardingService to execute them. This is conveyed by the 
 * CIM_NextHopForwardedByService association. NextHopRouting is deprecated in 
 * lieu of the more general, concrete NextHopRoute class. NextHopRoute allows 
 * the definition of BOTH a next hop address and an interface for 
 * transmission of the traffic. Also, it does not mandate the instantiation 
 * of a ForwardingService class. The latter is not needed if the sole purpose 
 * of the instance is to specify a 'desired/configured' route. This is simply 
 * a specification of the next hop.
