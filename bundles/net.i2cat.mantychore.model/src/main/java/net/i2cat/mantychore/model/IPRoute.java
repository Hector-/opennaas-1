/**
 * This Class contains accessor and mutator methods for all properties defined 
 * in the CIM class IPRoute as well as methods comparable to the 
 * invokeMethods defined for this class. This Class implements the 
 * IPRouteBean Interface. The CIM class IPRoute is described as follows: 
 * 
 * An IPRoute relates a destination address to the address or interface 
 * through which the remote address may be reached. The destination address 
 * may be a specific IP endpoint or a subnet, dependent on the mask. An 
 * instance of this class represents either static or dynamic routing. Static 
 * routes are distinguished by setting the IsStatic boolean property to TRUE. 
 * Since many routes between endpoints can be defined (using different route 
 * calculation algorithms), the CIM_IPRoute class is defined as Abstract. 
 * This forces subclassing (for example, see CIM_BGPIPRoute) and allows the 
 * instances of its subclasses to be distinguished based on their 
 * CreationClassName key property. IPRoute is deprecated in lieu of the more 
 * general, concrete NextHopIPRoute class. NextHopIPRoute allows the 
 * definition of BOTH a next hop address and an interface for transmission of 
 * the traffic. Also, it does not mandate the instantiation of a 
 * ForwardingService class.
